. Data Acquisition

Practical Instructions:

    Equipment: Use a DJI Mavic 2 or similar UAV.
    Settings: High resolution, 60-70% overlap.
    Flight Plan: Plan systematic flight paths over the target area to ensure complete coverage.

Theoretical Explanation:

    Purpose: High-resolution images and significant overlap ensure detailed 3D reconstruction and accurate measurements.
    Overlapping Images: Necessary for photogrammetry software to align and stitch images together accurately.

2. 3D Reconstruction Using Photogrammetry

Practical Instructions:

    Software: Use Agisoft Metashape.

    Import Images: Load all aerial images into Agisoft Metashape.
    Align Photos: Workflow > Align Photos (use high accuracy settings).
    Build Dense Point Cloud: Workflow > Build Dense Cloud with high/ultra-high quality settings.
    Generate Mesh: Workflow > Build Mesh from the dense point cloud.
    Build DEM: Workflow > Build DEM to create a Digital Elevation Model.
    Create Orthomosaic: Workflow > Build Orthomosaic.

Theoretical Explanation:

    Photogrammetry: The science of making measurements from photographs. The high overlap allows the software to identify common points and align the images, creating a 3D model.
    Dense Point Cloud: A collection of data points representing the 3D surface. Higher density provides more detailed reconstructions.
    DEM: Represents the bare ground surface without any objects like plants or buildings.

3. Create Canopy Height Model (CHM)

Practical Instructions:

    Generate DSM and DTM:

    python

    import rasterio
    import numpy as np

    # Load DSM and DTM
    with rasterio.open('path/to/dsm.tif') as dsm_src:
        dsm = dsm_src.read(1)

    with rasterio.open('path/to/dtm.tif') as dtm_src:
        dtm = dtm_src.read(1)

    # Calculate CHM
    chm = dsm - dtm

    # Save CHM
    with rasterio.open('path/to/chm.tif', 'w', **dsm_src.meta) as dst:
        dst.write(chm, 1)

Theoretical Explanation:

    DSM (Digital Surface Model): Represents the Earth's surface and includes objects like buildings and trees.
    DTM (Digital Terrain Model): Represents the bare ground surface.
    CHM (Canopy Height Model): Created by subtracting the DTM from the DSM, representing the height of vegetation above the ground.

4. Tree Detection and Segmentation

Using Deep Learning Models (Mask R-CNN):

    Train a Mask R-CNN Model: Train the model on labeled tree datasets.
    Run Detection:

    python

    from mrcnn.config import Config
    from mrcnn import model as modellib

    class TreeConfig(Config):
        NAME = "tree"
        IMAGES_PER_GPU = 2
        NUM_CLASSES = 1 + 1  # Background + tree
        STEPS_PER_EPOCH = 100
        DETECTION_MIN_CONFIDENCE = 0.9

    config = TreeConfig()
    model = modellib.MaskRCNN(mode="inference", config=config, model_dir="path/to/logs")
    model.load_weights("path/to/weights.h5", by_name=True)

    # Run detection
    results = model.detect([image], verbose=1)
    r = results[0]

Theoretical Explanation:

    Mask R-CNN: A deep learning model that performs object detection and instance segmentation. It can precisely detect and segment trees in images.
    Segmentation: Divides the image into segments, or regions, that correspond to different objects.

5. Volume Estimation

Practical Instructions:

A. Refine Tree Segmentation Using NDVI:

    Calculate NDVI:

    python

import rasterio
import numpy as np

def calculate_ndvi(nir_band, red_band):
    ndvi = (nir_band - red_band) / (nir_band + red_band)
    return ndvi

# Load NIR and Red bands
with rasterio.open('path/to/nir.tif') as nir_src:
    nir_band = nir_src.read(1)

with rasterio.open('path/to/red.tif') as red_src:
    red_band = red_src.read(1)

ndvi = calculate_ndvi(nir_band, red_band)

Apply NDVI Mask:

python

    # Apply NDVI mask to refine tree detection mask
    ndvi_mask = ndvi > 0.3  # Adjust threshold as needed
    refined_mask = r['masks'][:, :, 0] & ndvi_mask

    # Recalculate tree volume with refined mask
    refined_tree_volume = calculate_tree_volume(refined_mask, chm)
    print(f"Refined tree volume: {refined_tree_volume} cubic meters")

B. Voxel-Based Volume Calculation:

    Convert Segmented Trees to Voxel Grid:

    python

    import numpy as np

    def calculate_tree_volume(mask, chm, voxel_size=0.1):
        voxel_volume = voxel_size ** 3
        tree_heights = chm[mask > 0]
        tree_volume = np.sum(tree_heights) * voxel_volume
        return tree_volume

    # Example usage
    refined_mask = r['masks'][:, :, 0] & (ndvi > 0.3)  # Ensure the mask is applied
    tree_volume = calculate_tree_volume(refined_mask, chm)
    print(f"Estimated tree volume: {tree_volume} cubic meters")

Theoretical Explanation:

    NDVI: The NDVI is a commonly used vegetation index that helps distinguish between vegetative and non-vegetative surfaces. It leverages the difference in reflectance between the red and near-infrared bands, with higher values indicating healthy vegetation.
    Voxel-Based Estimation: By converting the 3D tree model into a grid of small cubes (voxels), you can estimate the volume more accurately. Each voxel represents a fraction of the total volume,
